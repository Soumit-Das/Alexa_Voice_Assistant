The project uses various Python libraries and modules, such as:

speech_recognition: Used for speech recognition to understand user commands.
pyttsx3: Provides text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to speak.
pywhatkit: Enables the assistant to perform tasks like searching on the web and playing YouTube videos.
datetime: Used for getting the current time and date.
wikipedia: Allows the assistant to fetch information from Wikipedia.
pyjokes: Provides a collection of jokes that the assistant can tell.
